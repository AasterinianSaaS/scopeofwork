Roofers

User clicks Generate Scope

Tool outputs a scope using the 5-Part Universal Industry Framework (below)

User gets options:

Copy to Clipboard (primary CTA)

Download PDF

Download TXT

Polish Language (optional AI)

Uses Claude Haiku or Opus Mini for low cost

Rewrites while preserving structure

User pastes scope into Jobber, QuickBooks, email, text, etc.

User bookmarks page and shares it with coworkers.

⭐ UNIVERSAL SCOPE FRAMEWORK (Industry-Validated)

This is based on construction SOW guides, contractor blogs, and real job templates.
This framework must ALWAYS appear with every input combination.

1. Project Overview

Summarize:

what the work is

where it’s happening

purpose of the job

2. Scope of Work

Use structured bullets. Conditioned by user inputs:

main job tasks

quantities (if provided)

connection/testing

haul-away (if checked)

permits/inspections (if checked)

surface prep and cleanup

“per code” language for professional tone

3. Materials & Responsibilities

Based on dropdown:

Contractor to furnish materials

Owner to furnish materials

Mixed responsibility
Include notes if the user typed them.

4. Exclusions & Not Included

Always include a baseline list:

structural changes

relocation of systems

drywall/paint unless specified

flooring work

concealed/unforeseen conditions
Then append user-entered exclusions or notes.

5. Changes & Extras Clause

A MUST HAVE — backed by real contractor advice:

“Any work outside this scope or due to unforeseen conditions will be priced and approved as a separate change order.”

This is the line that protects them from scope creep.

⭐ SCOPE LENGTH MODES
Brief

3–5 bullets
Minimal caveats
Short overview

Standard

Full 5-section structure
Normal detail
Best for most users

Detailed

Adds more bullets:

break main tasks into several sub-tasks

more detail about quantities, prep, cleanup

professional jargon/phrasing

This directly solves the “too vague vs too detailed” argument contractors have online.

⭐ TONE MODES
Simple

For homeowners.
Plain English. No jargon.

Standard

Balanced, professional but readable.

Professional

Uses industry language:

furnish and install

per code

workmanlike manner

complete operational system

coordinate inspections

Contractors LOVE this phrasing because it feels legit.

⭐ FEATURE SET (Frontend Only)

All vibe-codable:

Optional (but recommended)

Layout for homepage:

Hero title + subheadline

“Generate Your Scope” box

Inputs (simple vertical form)

Generate button (big)

Make it feel like a tool, not a SaaS.

⭐ NO BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

⭐ OPTIONAL FUTURE EXPANSIONS (Not built now)

Claude should be aware but NOT build:

Saved scopes (requires backend)

These can be feedback-driven additions.

⭐ PRIMARY GOAL

Deliver a finished, reliable, conversion-focused contractor scope generator that:

generates consistent, professional scopes

works universally across trades

matches contractor best practices

protects against scope creep

looks good on mobile

requires no backend

supports SEO growth

can be expanded later

This is MVP+ quality but still vibe-codable in days.
